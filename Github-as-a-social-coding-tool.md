# Github as a social coding tool
GitHub,  a great web-based Git repository hosting service, offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management functionality. However, the most outstanding feature of GitHub is its social coding.

You can see what other people are working on and whom they are connecting with. This is great for a project that requires multiple people doing different roles at the same time.

Not only watching others’ project, you may join someone’s project if you find yourself being able to contribute to it. By sending a **pull request** to the person who has created the project, you can add more features on his/her project!

If you’re a project manager, you can send invitations to whom you want to work together as **collaborators** or send **pull request** to whom you want any feedback from them.

What is, however, the most troublesome problem in working on a project with others? That is when the original file has been changed and nobody knows how it’s changed. With Github, you can work on your own branch keep all tracks of everyone’s changes. That is how our group could complete this assignment even though I’m traveling [at the westernmost point of the Eurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabo_da_Roca) for exam break:grin:
