Lessons Learned
An important takeaway to this class is that even if you do not have experience actually inputting coding you can still contribute
to the development of a project by learning about the process and what the development team does on a day to day basis.

If you plan on leading a team of developers remember to keep open communication, instrinsically incentivize, and have realisic
expectations.
